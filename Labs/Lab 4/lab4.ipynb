posible esbozar una leve relación entre el nivel educacional de los padres y el promedio de los alumnos.

Sin embargo, esta relación no es tan clara, ya que se va perdiendo a medida que inspeccionamos los cuantiles superiores (véanse los GPAs más altos de cada nivel educacional en el gráfico) por lo que, si bien es posible observar una tendencia en los cuantiles inferiores, es posible que el nivel educacional no sea muy buen predictor del GPA a niveles superiores debido a la injerencia de otros factores no observados.\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"bb6e4f776a2043c1ad240cfb8fb908b1","deepnote_cell_height":264,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"Rg4ZMq8ezAH6","owner_user_id":"badcc427-fd3d-4615-9296-faa43ec69cfb"},"source":["# Conclusión\n","Eso ha sido todo para el lab de hoy, recuerden que el laboratorio tiene un plazo de entrega de una semana.
